# HTML page for the sake of being approved in the course I'm taking :chicken:

It's a page with random/retro things, I have to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The page still needs a lot of improvement.

It has:

A main page;

An header with random stuff and a button leading to a fake subscription page;

Three pages of old gifs;

And more.
